# Motivation

There has never been a perfect tool for writing and maintaining CVs and resumes.

-   **Microsoft Word is painful to use:** Content and formatting are so intertwined that you cannot update your CV without breaking the formatting.
-   **Online CV generators are not good enough:** They are usually non-professional and impossible to customize. Also, it's very hard to reproduce the same CV years later.
-   **Overleaf is good but not a CV tool:** Overelaf is a general-purpose $\LaTeX$ editor. There is always a trade-off between generality and the user experience when creating something very specific (a CV).
-   **We cannot access or edit our CVs from our phones.** The only option is to get lost in our cloud drives while looking for the most recent PDF we used for an application a couple of months back.

There hasn't been a robust, customizable, and professional cross-platform CV maintenance and version-control app. The open-source RenderCV lays the groundwork for creating such an app, which would allow professionals to manage their CVs on their phones and computers.

With RenderCV App:

-   You can access your CVs from your phone and the web.
-   You will have the complete control over the $\LaTeX$ code.
-   You can version control your CVs and archive them throughout the years.
-   Your CV will always be reproducible since RenderCV is an open-source Python package.
